This prototype shows a possible implementation of <a href="https://www.gipp.com/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/gipp2017b.pdf">CryptSubmit</a> in an existing system.<br><br>
The following is the abstract of the before mentioned paper which describes brief the use of such a system:<br><br>
<i>Manuscript submission systems are a central fixture in scholarly
    publishing. However, researchers who submit their unpublished
    work to a conference or journal must trust that the system and its
    provider will not accidentally or willfully leak unpublished
    findings. Additionally, researchers must trust that the program
    committee and the anonymous peer reviewers will not plagiarize
    unpublished ideas or results. To address these weaknesses, we
    propose a method that automatically creates a publicly verifiable,
    tamper-proof timestamp for manuscripts utilizing the
    decentralized Bitcoin blockchain. The presented method hashes
    each submitted manuscript and uses the API of the timestamping
    service OriginStamp to persistently embed this manuscript hash
    on Bitcoinâ€™s blockchain. Researchers can use this tamper-proof
    trusted timestamp to prove that their manuscript existed in its
    specific form at the time of submission to a conference or journal.
    This verifiability allows researchers to stake a claim to their
    research findings and intellectual property, even in the face of
    vulnerable submission platforms or dishonest peer reviewers.
    Optionally, the system also associates trusted timestamps with the
    feedback and ideas shared by peer reviewers to increase the
    traceability of ideas. The proposed concept, which we introduce
    as CryptSubmit, is currently being integrated into the open-source
    conference management system OJS. In the future, the method
    could be integrated at nearly no overhead cost into other
    manuscript submission systems, such as EasyChair, ConfTool, or
    Ambra. The introduced method can also improve electronic preprint
    services and storage systems for research data.</i><br><br>
