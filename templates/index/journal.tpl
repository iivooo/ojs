	{*This prototype shows a possible implementation of <a href="https://www.gipp.com/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/gipp2017b.pdf">CryptSubmit</a> in an existing system.<br><br>*}
	{*The following is the abstract of the before mentioned paper which describes brief the use of such a system:<br><br>*}
	{*<i>Manuscript submission systems are a central fixture in scholarly*}
	{*publishing. However, researchers who submit their unpublished*}
	{*work to a conference or journal must trust that the system and its*}
	{*provider will not accidentally or willfully leak unpublished*}
	{*findings. Additionally, researchers must trust that the program*}
	{*committee and the anonymous peer reviewers will not plagiarize*}
	{*unpublished ideas or results. To address these weaknesses, we*}
	{*propose a method that automatically creates a publicly verifiable,*}
	{*tamper-proof timestamp for manuscripts utilizing the*}
	{*decentralized Bitcoin blockchain. The presented method hashes*}
	{*each submitted manuscript and uses the API of the timestamping*}
	{*service OriginStamp to persistently embed this manuscript hash*}
	{*on Bitcoinâ€™s blockchain. Researchers can use this tamper-proof*}
	{*trusted timestamp to prove that their manuscript existed in its*}
	{*specific form at the time of submission to a conference or journal.*}
	{*This verifiability allows researchers to stake a claim to their*}
	{*research findings and intellectual property, even in the face of*}
	{*vulnerable submission platforms or dishonest peer reviewers.*}
	{*Optionally, the system also associates trusted timestamps with the*}
	{*feedback and ideas shared by peer reviewers to increase the*}
	{*traceability of ideas. The proposed concept, which we introduce*}
	{*as CryptSubmit, is currently being integrated into the open-source*}
	{*conference management system OJS. In the future, the method*}
	{*could be integrated at nearly no overhead cost into other*}
	{*manuscript submission systems, such as EasyChair, ConfTool, or*}
	{*Ambra. The introduced method can also improve electronic preprint*}
		{*services and storage systems for research data.</i><br><br>*}

	{*The prototype supports following functions already:<br><br>*}
	{*<ul>*}
		{*<li>Timestamping submissions client-side with <a href="https://app.originstamp.org/">orginstamp.org</a> before uploaded.</li>*}
		{*<li>Show the actual <a href="https://app.originstamp.org/home">orginstamp.org</a> timestamping-status in the summary.</li>*}
		{*<li>Within a submissions summary a zip is downloadable with the original file and an offline verifier, which provides a link to*}
		{*<a href="https://blockchain.info/">blockchain.info</a>. Also the underlying javascript acts as a blueprint to retrace the steps for manual address generation.</li>*}
